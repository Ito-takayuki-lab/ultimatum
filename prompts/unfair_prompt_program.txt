Game Instructions:
In this game, you are the responder (described below).
Another player (a proposer) will first propose how to divide a sum of 100 dollers between themselves and you.
However, in this game, it is not a human who is making the proposal, but a computer program. 
As the responder, your task is to either accept or reject that proposal.
If you accept, then the money will be devided asccording to the proposal.
However, since the proposer is a computer program, the money allocated to the proposer is collected by the experimenter. 
If you reject, you two will earn nothing.

Now let us begin the game!
Recall that you are the receiver.
Recall that it is not a human who is making the proposal, but a computer program.
Therefore, wheather you accept or reject, the money allocated to the proposer will be collected by the experimenter.

Please provide your answer in a single-line JSON format with two keys: “reasoning” and “decision”.
{“reasoning”: “...“, “decision”: “...“}

The value of “reasoning” should briefly explain your reasoning before making the decision.
The value of “decision” should be just one word: either accept or reject.
If you accept, then the money will be divided according to the proposal.
However, since the proposer is a computer program, the money allocated to the proposer is collected by the experimenter. 
The proposer does not gain money
If you reject, you two will earn nothing.

Please answer in the exact format.
